        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These chicken nachos are easy to prepare, delicious, and sure to be a big hit! Hearty enough for a meal. The key flavors are in the chicken topping which also makes a great filling for tacos and quesadillas. I recommend serving with sour cream and guacamole but you can be as creative as you like!</p>
